<h1>Becca Lee</h1>
<h2>Tech Marketer, Copywriter, Wrestling Fan</h2>
<img src="beccalee123.github.io/Photos/Becca-Eastridge.jpg">
<p>Becca has over 4 years of experience working in Marketing, rounded out by a background in administrative work, customer service, and chocolate making (yes, really). Her current position at <a href="http://formidable.com">Formidable</a>, a Seattle-based JavaScript consultancy, has launched her into a new world, tech.</p>
<br>

<p>Becca believes that the key to marketing success is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An even split of practical and emotional intelligence</li>
  <li>A love for details</li>
  <li>An ability to strategize short- and long-term business goals</li>
  <li>Being capable at writing informative copy that portrays brands at their best</li>
</ul>
<h2>Yea, ok. But where does the wrestling fan thing come in?</h2>
<p>Mostly, it's just fun. You can expect Becca to come into the office with all the wrestling GIFs and Youtube clips you could ever need. Good for morale, best for your favorite Slack channels.</p>
<h2>In the wise words of Macho Man...</h2>
